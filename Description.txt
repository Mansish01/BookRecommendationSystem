Dataset Description

Source Files:

Books.csv: Contains book descriptions and metadata.
Ratings.csv: Contains the ratings provided for the books.
Users.csv: Contains user information and demographics.

Project Approach

1. Data Preparation
Objective: Establish relationships between users and books based on ratings.
Merged datasets to create a cohesive view of user-book interactions.
Created a pivot table with users and books to structure the data for modeling.

2. Sparse Matrix Conversion
Converted the pivot table into a Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) Matrix.
This format was used as input to the collaborative filtering model to optimize memory usage and computation.

3. Collaborative Filtering
Technique: Collaborative filtering was applied to recommend books to users based on ratings.

4. Clustering
Implemented clustering on the CSR matrix to group users or books with similar characteristics.
Leveraged these clusters for enhanced recommendation accuracy and analysis.

Output Visualization
Framework Used: Streamlit
A user-friendly interface was developed for easy visualization and interaction.
